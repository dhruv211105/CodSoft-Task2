Task Completed! 
Iâ€™m happy to share that I have successfully completed the Password Generator project as part of my CodSoft Internship in Python Development.
This project enhanced my skills in Python programming, randomization techniques, and user input handling while building a tool that creates strong and secure passwords for users.

A big thanks to CodSoft for providing this opportunity to learn and grow through hands-on projects!
